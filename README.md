# # Blazor / CSharp Poker Code

This is my first Blazor project, and my return to C# after a long absence.

Shockingly, the hand evaluation library started with the ubiquitous poker.eval (see LICENSE-poker-eval) and a C# port by Keith Rule - Sept 2005, updated May 2006.
The SVG Cards came from Adrian Kennard at https://www.me.uk/cards/.  See https://www.revk.uk/2018/06/svg-vector-playing-cards.html for details.

## Goals

- Experiment with Blazor and C# again, and scratch an itch on Poker Analysis.
- Try to create a general framework for different varieties of Poker beyond Hold'em (ex. Omaha, Taiwanese.)
- Give me something to do during the pandemic induced lockdown.
